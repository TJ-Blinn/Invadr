# INVADR - A simple catalogue of games you love!

## Overview

Invadr is a catalogue of over 500,000 games, which can be sorted by Genre, and liked by a User. It sources its data using the RAWG API. Users can then view their profiles to see a list of games they've liked.

<br>

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the npm install command.
4. Create the `.env` file with the information below

```
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=reviewr
PGDATABASE=reviewrdb
PGPASSWORD=reviewr
PGPORT=5432
```

5. Log into psql with:

```
psql -d reviewrdb -U reviewr
```

6. Create the schema with the following command within psql:

```
\i db/migrations/tables.sql;
```

7. Seed the users with the following command:

```
\i db/seeds/users.sql;
```

8. To run the backend server, in a new terminal, from the project root directory, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

9. To run the frontend server, use the following commands sequentially:

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `FilterBanner.jsx` and `Likes.jsx`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples.

You can use the drop down under "Pick a Genre" to select a genre of game, which will return 20 games under that genre. Each game has a like button which gets saved to your personal likes. For the example below, I am using selecting puzzle, and liking the first game on the shown only.
